# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

years = 90 - int(age)
months = round(years * 12)
weeks = round(years * 52)
days = round(years * 365)

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
